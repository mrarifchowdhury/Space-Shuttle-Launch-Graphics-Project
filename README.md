# Space-Shuttle-Launch-Graphics-Project

OpenGL

This scenario is totally based on space rocket launching sequence. A space rocket is waiting to launch and astronauts are coming to launching zone through bus. After leaving bus, astronauts start walking to space rocket. Astronauts are heading to space rocket. Using space rocket holder, they go up and enter to upper side of rocket. Doing all that task, screen initiates countdown which starts from 1 and ends with 3. At number 3 the rocket starts a launching sequence. If it is possible, then we will try to add some extra features to make it more beautiful.
